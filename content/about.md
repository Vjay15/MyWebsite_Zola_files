Hello Everyone! I am Vjaylakshman currently a student pursuing two degrees as you might have seen in the home page. I am a tinkerer at heart and love to checkout and learn
new things then and there when I get the time to do so. My hobbies are mostly centered around reading books, listening to music, surfing the internet, reading manga, watching anime, reading wikipedia pages sometimes :p and at times sports. 

I am Indian and of Tamil origin and currently reside at Chennai, TamilNadu, India. I haven't travelled anywhere apart from the nearest big cities to me, but I have so much plans to discover the world and go around! Wow, writing an about me page is the most hardest task ever.

If you want to collaborate on a project or just have a chat with me, you can contact me via email that is in the footer! I can reply to the messages sent on other platforms but the reply might take some time 😅
